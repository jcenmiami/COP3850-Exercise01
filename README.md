CGS 3850 - Exercise 1 

Based on the material covered in chapter 1, you are asked to create a very simple project. 

Create an HTML file with embedded JavaScript code.  

When the user opens the file, it should first display an alert box with a short phrase â€“ your choice. 

Then, when the user clicks ok and the alert box closes, have the code display your first and last name.
